# Project Nirvana
**Milestone project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute**

This project represents the fictional band Nirvanas homepage, the band no longer exists. 
On the homepage there is information about the band, links to music videos from their diffent albums and a contact page where you can get in contact to book the band for shows.
The homepage is built with bootstrap components, including a navbar, jumbotron and cards and can be viewed on multiple screen sizes.
It is user friendly and has a color theme and style that fits the brand.

## Demo
A live demo version can be found **[here](https://berkan08.github.io/milestone-project-nirvana2/)**

An image demonstrating how the page shows on different screen sizes can be found **[here](https://github.com/Berkan08/milestone-project-nirvana2/blob/master/assets/wireframes/Responsive.png)**

## UX
This site is for Nirvana fans who want to get into contact with the band to book them into concerts. 
On the homepage there is a button that directs the users straight to the contact page, but the users can also find some info and media about the band on the site.

## User stories:
1. As an organizer for Nirvana fans I want to book the band for a concert. I go to the homepage, click on the contact us button and get directed to the contact form.
2. As a Nirvana fan I want to find some media on the band. I go to the performances section and listen to their albums.

## Strategy
The goal in the design was to make it  a minimalist and user-friendly design as possible while giving the users info, media and a means to get in contact with the band.

## Structure
The site is structured to get to the right page as easily as possible.
Link to the contact page can be found in the navigation bar and also clearly visible on the home page.

## Skeleton
By using Balsamiq the following wireframes were created:

[Nirvana wireframe](https://github.com/Berkan08/milestone-project-nirvana2/blob/master/assets/wireframes/Nirvana%20wireframes.pdf)

## Surface
The colours yellow, black and white were used to fit the bands logotype.
After a search on fonts on google fonts, Lora was chosen as the font for the text on the page that fits with the logo.
The buttons are styled in the same overal color scheme as the rest of the page and transition to white when hovering over them.

## Technologies
1. HTML - To create basic site
2. CSS - To style the page
3. Bootstrap - For responsive design
4. Balsamiq - To create wireframes

## Features
On the about us section there is information about the band and a button directing the user to the contact us section.
In the performances section there is information and pictures on different albums and buttons that links to youtube videos. 
In the contact section there is a form where the user can send the band an inquiry. 
There is also a footer with links to different social media.

## Testing
All links will function. The social media icons in the footer will link to the main page of the social media.
This site was tested across multiple screen sizes on Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer.
A navigation bar is shown all the time and will transform to an option bar on smaller phone screens. The text and card-decks will properly align on every screen size.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages.
